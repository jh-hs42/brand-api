# Product Vision

## Introduction
The Brand API is a centralized service designed to manage all corporate and product brand elements for Messe Frankfurt. It addresses the current challenges of fragmented branding, inconsistent implementations, and redundant work across applications.

## Problem Statement
Messe Frankfurt's brand assets are currently scattered across multiple systems and applications. Different teams and external vendors maintain duplicates, leading to inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and high coordination costs. Existing processes are manual, lack standardization, and are not scalable.

## Goal
The Brand API aims to provide a single source of truth for all brand-related data (colors, logos, typography, brand values) that can be consumed by internal systems, websites, marketing tools, and future AI applications.

## Success Metrics
- 100% of digital touchpoints consume brand data from the Brand API
- Reduction in redundant asset creation by 100%
- Consistent brand presentation across all applications and products
- Scalability for future SAP Cloud and AI integrations
